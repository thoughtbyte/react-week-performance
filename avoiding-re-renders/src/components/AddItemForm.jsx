/**
 * Notice we're using a PureComponent here. PureComponents check the current state and props
 * against the next state and props. It won't re-render if they're equal, according to a shallow
 * compare. The only prop this component gets is the handleSubmit function. If that function
 * is bound in the *render* function of the App component, instead of the constructor,
 * a new function would be created each time, and the PureComponent would re-render even though
 * it doesn't need to.
