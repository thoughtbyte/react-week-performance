      Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. You can bend rivers. But
      when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. There it is.
      Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use your imagination, let it go. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. Maybe
      there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his
      beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. Everyone is going to
      see things differently - and that's the way it should be. Don't kill all your dark
      areas - you need them to show the light.

      Working it up and down, back and forth. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your
      mind and create all these happy things? Anytime you learn something your time and
      energy are not wasted. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be.
    </p>

      We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. I'm going to mix up a
      little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian
      Blue.

      I'm a water fanatic. I love water. Let's do it again then, what the heck. In life
      you need colors. Fluff that up. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world.
      Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do
      anything.

      Just beat the devil out of it. We need dark in order to show light. Every single
      thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends
      with the little rascals.

      Those great big fluffy clouds. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. Once
      you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. This
      is the fun part There we go.
